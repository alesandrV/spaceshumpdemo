Simple space shooter game SPACE SHMUP (Unity v. 2019.3.14)

- 3:4 screen resolution.
- Simple WASD control system.
- 4 enemy types with personalized moving style.
- Shooting system with two types of weapon.
- Destroyed enemies can drop power-up with a 25 - 100% chance.
- Power-ups can be 3 random types: one level for shield, additional blaster, or addition spread gun.
- Shield level numeration reacts with enemies' contact.
- Boss-enemy with a unique destroying system (part by part).
- Moving stars at the background.

My first try to use class inheritance and virtual methods. 
A simple game from "Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development" by Jeremy Gibson Bond.

Thank you for your time and have a nice day. :)
